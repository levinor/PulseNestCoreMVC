PulseNestCoreMVC

Wellcome to my little, art like, experiment. Please don't be hard on the front end it needs a lot of love and I've this project on hold. This was an experiment to play with TwitterAPI and SignalR.
The Concept

The main concept is to have an emotional analisys of Twitter in real time represented graphically. For this I analice a stream of tweets filtering by key words and represent the main feel of the tweet with a dot of color in a global map.
Current status

The background part is almost completed. May be some changes can be done to achieve more dots per second ni the map, but the main concept (with the free Tweeter API) is completed. The code needs a lot of refactor, of course. And the front end needs a lot of love...
